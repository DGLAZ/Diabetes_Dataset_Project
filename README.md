# Comprehensive Report on Diabetes Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health indicators. The dataset used for this project is the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset, which contains healthcare statistics and lifestyle survey data.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of 253,680 instances and 21 features, including:
- HighBP: High Blood Pressure
- HighChol: High Cholesterol
- CholCheck: Cholesterol Check
- BMI: Body Mass Index
- Smoker: Smoking Status
- Stroke: History of Stroke
- HeartDiseaseorAttack: History of Heart Disease or Attack
- PhysActivity: Physical Activity
- Fruits: Fruit Consumption
- Veggies: Vegetable Consumption
- HvyAlcoholConsump: Heavy Alcohol Consumption
- AnyHealthcare: Access to Healthcare
- NoDocbcCost: No Doctor because of Cost
- GenHlth: General Health
- MentHlth: Mental Health
- PhysHlth: Physical Health
- DiffWalk: Difficulty Walking
- Sex: Gender
- Age: Age
- Education: Education Level
- Income: Income Level

The target variable is `Diabetes_binary`, indicating whether the individual has diabetes (1) or not (0).

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Loading the Data**: The dataset was fetched using the `ucimlrepo` library.
2. **Data Inspection**: The first few rows and the structure of the dataset were inspected to understand the data.
3. **Missing Values**: Missing values were checked using the `missingno` library, and it was found that there were no missing values in the dataset.
4. **Duplicated Values**: Duplicated values were checked and removed from the dataset.
5. **Data Description**: The dataset was described to understand the distribution of the features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
1. **Correlation Analysis**: The correlation between the features and the target variable was analyzed to identify the most significant predictors of diabetes.
2. **Visualization**: Various visualizations were created to understand the distribution and relationships between the features.

## Data Preparation
1. **Feature and Target Separation**: The features and target variable were separated.
2. **Train-Test Split**: The data was split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 split.
3. **Standardization**: The features were standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure that all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

## Machine Learning Models
Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated on the dataset:
1. **Logistic Regression**: Achieved an accuracy of 84.90%.
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**: Achieved an accuracy of 77.36%.
3. **Random Forest Classifier**: Achieved an accuracy of 84.15%.
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier**: Achieved an accuracy of 83.11%.
5. **XGBoost Classifier**: Achieved an accuracy of 85.03%.

## Model Evaluation
1. **Accuracy**: The accuracy of each model was calculated and compared.
2. **Classification Report**: Precision, recall, and F1-score were extracted for each model.
3. **Confusion Matrix**: Confusion matrices were plotted for each model to visualize the performance.

## Model Comparison
The models were compared based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The XGBoost Classifier performed the best with an accuracy of 85.03%.

## Predictions on Arbitrary Test Data
Arbitrary test data was created and standardized. Predictions were made using the XGBoost model, and the results were displayed.

## Conclusion
The project successfully predicted the likelihood of diabetes using various machine learning models. The XGBoost Classifier was the best-performing model. The results can be used to identify individuals at risk of diabetes and take preventive measures.

## Future Work
1. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features can be created to improve model performance.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Hyperparameters of the models can be tuned to achieve better accuracy.
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Ensemble methods can be explored to combine the predictions of multiple models for improved performance.
